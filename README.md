# Rule_30
CodingTest

I was a little confused by what was wanted out of the test but I had fun with it anyway.  Tap or pan to interact with the visuals. I recommend running on a device.

I've spent about 5 hours on the rule 30 project. I would clean up the constant numbers and break a couple of functions apart if I were to spend more time on the project. 

Enjoy.
